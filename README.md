## LibreWolf config by starkle
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is a highly customizable open-source browser from Mozilla. The people behind the [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/docs/features/) project do the hard work of configuring and distributing a version of Firefox that is private, minimal, and free. The config in this repo aims to further realize those goals.
